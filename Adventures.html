            <h1>Birding Experience at Bundala National Park</h1>
            <p class="head-para a-container-1-head-para">
                Bundala National Park’s wetland and saltern habitat is home to a large collection of resident birds, as well as migrants that visit every winter, from waders to raptors. Sightings of other key species such as elephants, crocodiles, wild boar, buffalo, spotted deer, and terrestrial birds can be expected.

                    Bundala National Park is a birdwatcher's paradise, located in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka. The park is home to over 200 species of birds, including both resident and migratory species. Some of the most common birds seen in the park include flamingos, pelicans, egrets, herons, spoonbills, ducks, and geese. The park is also home to a number of raptors, such as hawks, eagles, and owls.
                    The best time to go birdwatching in Bundala National Park is during the dry season, from November to April. During this time, the water levels in the park are low, making it easier to spot the birds. The park is also less crowded during this time. <br> <br>
                    There are a number of ways to go birdwatching in Bundala National Park. You can either go on a guided tour or explore the park on your own. If you go on a guided tour, the guide will help you to identify the birds and point out the best places to see them. If you explore the park on your own, be sure to be respectful of the park and its wildlife.
                    Some of the best places to go birdwatching in Bundala National Park include the mangrove swamp, mudflats, saltpans, lagoons, and forests. When birdwatching, it is important to be patient and quiet, so you don't scare the birds away. You should also use binoculars to get a closer look at the birds.
